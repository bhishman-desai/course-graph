# Course Graph

## Project Overview
This project is a collection of classes that perform a process to build a curriculum with courses and their prerequisites. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Add the courses into the curriculum**: Each course has a unique course ID and a course name. Additional information such as course capacity (number of students it can accommodate) and demand value (number of students interested in this course based on the prerequisite of the course) is also included.

2. **Schedule the course**: In this step, we register for the course and set the capacity of the course.

3. **Add prerequisites of the courses in the curriculum**: The final step is to add prerequisites of the courses in the curriculum. We also set the demand value of the course based upon the percentage of students which have shown interest in the course from the previous/prerequisite course.

The goal is to work with the interrelation of the data between the courses in the curriculum.
